# birfday

Get reminders to send friends/family birthday texts.

# Setup

This uses `pipenv` to manage the virtual env and all dependencies. If you don't have pipenv install it [here](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) then:

```
git clone https://github.com/automagictv/birfday.git
cd birfday
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
```

For this to work, we need Birthday data in our database. If this is the first time you're running this application, start by seeding the data. Instructions on how to do this are below.
